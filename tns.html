These specialized sessions not only allow for the exchange of digital business cards, but immerse participants in three-dimensional environments designed to foster professional development, leadership and innovation. In these sessions, employees have the opportunity to participate in interactive workshops and keynotes led by thought leaders in their respective fields. Virtual reality makes these experiences more immersive than ever, providing realistic simulations of business scenarios and opportunities to practice negotiation, communication and decision-making skills in a safe virtual environment.</p>
